# Integrating Predictive Analytics and Anomaly Detection for Cyanobacterial Bloom Forecasting

## Abstract:

Harmful algal blooms (HABs) caused by cyanobacteria are increasingly threatening global freshwater ecosystems. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system for forecasting cyanobacterial blooms, detecting environmental anomalies, and classifying high-risk regions for cyanotoxin exposure. Utilizing Python-based analytical tools, the project leverages time-series forecasting models (ARIMA, LSTM) and anomaly detection techniques (Isolation Forest, DBSCAN) to analyze satellite and environmental datasets.

## Project Stages

1.	Data Collection and Preparation:
   Sourcing, cleaning, and preprocessing datasets
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis:
   Summarizing and visualizing relationships in data
3.	Model Development and Training:
   Building and evaluating ARIMA, LSTM, and anomaly detection models
4.	Hybrid System Development (Next Steps):
   Integrating forecasting and anomaly detection for real-time alerts
6.	Evaluation and Reporting:
   Documenting insights and results

## Next Steps:
   •	Develop a SARIMA model to incorporate seasonal trends.
   
   •	Enhance hybrid system integration for better real-time anomaly detection.
   
   •	Address limitations like missing data and improve accuracy metrics.
